Description: A package for repeated measures ANOVA models. 
    Allows to simulate data, compute ANOVA and RM ANOVA 
    models, investigate error term reduction due to model selection, 
    compute and display adjusted confidence intervals. 
    Furthermore it enables to conduct Mauchly's test for 
    sphericity and it provides various correction factors to 
    adjust p-values in the presence of sphericity. The package 
    also supplies a function to fit orthogonal polynomial 
    contrasts and to plot orthogonal polynomial regression curves.
