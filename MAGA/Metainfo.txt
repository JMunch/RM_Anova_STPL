Name of Quantlet: ow_rma

Published in: 	  Statistical Programming Languages

Description:      'This bundled package (see related quantlets) computes the One-way Repeated Measures ANOVA 
		  including inferencial statistical analysis and a simulated data for testing purposes.
		  - ow_rma computes the RM ANOVA model and gives the ANOVA table as output
		  - ow_rma_ci computes both adjusted and unadjusted confidence intervals
		  - ow_rma_eta gives the effect size measures
		  - ow_rma_opc detects orthogonal polynomial trend components in the effects of the factor
		  - ow_rma_spheri checks the requirement of sphericity in the data
		  - ow_rma_sse_reduct evaluates the reduction in SSE due to consideration/elimination of 
		    between subjects variance
		  - sim_ow_rma_data simulates test data with ability to control factor level, number of observations,
		    variance, etc.'

Keywords:         ANOVA, repeated, measures, variance, simulation, confidence-interval, sphericity, R-package
