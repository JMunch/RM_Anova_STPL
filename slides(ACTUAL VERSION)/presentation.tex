\item A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests
\item Makes it easy to share and publish code with others (CRAN, Github via Devtools)
\item Loads all relevant functions into the namespace
\item Automatically checks and installs dependency if necessary
\item Packages allow to document functions, so that they easily be used by others (help function, argument list, etc.)

		\end{itemize}
		\item Error handling
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Make sure that functions are robust regarding violation of the required input, e.g. character vector supplied although a numeric vector is needed. Use if-statements or try().
