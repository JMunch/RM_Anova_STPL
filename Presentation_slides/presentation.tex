\frametitle{Motivation for Making a Package}

\begin{itemize}
\item A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests
\item Makes it easy to share and publish code with others (CRAN, Github via Devtools)
\item Loads all relevant functions into the namespace
\item Automatically checks and installs dependency if necessary
\item Packages allow to document functions, so that they easily be used by others (help function, argument list, etc.)
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame[containsverbatim]{
	\frametitle{Tools to Create a Package in R}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item roxygen2
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Enables documentation to be written directly into the R script
		\end{itemize}
		\item devtools
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Load packages still under development e.g. from Github
		\end{itemize}
		\item Github
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A package can be handled like a repository, which enables colloboration
		\end{itemize}
		\item RStudio
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Provides many helpful functionalities for creating a package (create, build, check)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\frame[containsverbatim]{
	\frametitle{Things to consider}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Use function names that speak for themselves and use them consistently.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \grqq{}There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things.\grqq{} Phil Karlton
		\end{itemize}
		\item Error handling
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Make sure that functions are robust regarding violation of the required input, e.g. character vector supplied although a numeric vector is needed. Use if-statements or try().
		\end{itemize}
		\item Custom error and warning messages
		\begin{itemize}
			\item stop() interrupts the code and returns an error message
			\item warning() executes the code but returns a warning message

$\widetilde{Y}$ vs. $\tilde{Y}$
